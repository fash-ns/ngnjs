## Caching

NGNJs supports two driver for handling cache: *File* and *Redis*.
You need to have redis-server if you want to use Redis cache driver.

you can use cache ability by importing one of *RedisCache* or *FileCache*:

```javascript
import RedisCache from "ngn/dist/services/cache/RedisCache";
import FileCache from "ngn/dist/services/cache/FileCache";
```

### Methods supported by cache drivers:

1. `async get(key, defaultValue)`: returns value of key in cache storage if
key is existed and default value otherwise.
2. `async set(key, value, ttl?)`: Sets a key in cache storage with the
   provided value for a specific time which is set with TTL
   (TTL is in seconds). If ttl is not provided, key will be kept forever
3. `async delete(key)`: Deletes a key from cache storage
4. `async clear()`: Deletes all keys.
5. `async getMultiple(keys)`: Gets an array of keys and returns an object
of key value pair.
6. `async setMultiple(object)`: Gets an object of key values and sets them
in cache storage.
7. `async deleteMultiple(keys)`: Gets an array of keys and deletes them.
8. `async getTTL(key)`: Returns remaining time to live of a key.
9. `async has(key)`: Returns *true* if key is existed and *false* otherwise.
