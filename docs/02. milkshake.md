## Milkshake

Milkshake is a cli script for making files from templates and generating APP_KEY
(APP_KEY is used for encryption). Supported commands are described bellow:

### init

This command initiates NGNJs for use. What is created during initialization is
described in installation section.

### make

This command makes a file from template. For now, templates are:

1. api: `milkshake make api` asks you some simple questions and makes an api
endpoint for you. base path of api is `/pages/api` and you can give milkshake
a path as api name to make your endpoint file in a sub path. For example if you
choose your api name as `users/index`, an api file called *index* is created in
`pages/api/users/` directory.
2. middleware: `milkshake make middleware` asks you the name of your middleware
and creates a middleware file in `src/middlewares/` directory. Don't worry if you
don't have *middlewares* directory. It will be created when needed. You can give
a path as name to create this file in a sub directory under `src/middlewares/`.
3. page: `milkshake make page` asks you some questions and makes a page template
for you under `pages/` directory. You can give a path as name to create this
file in a sub directory under `pages/`.
4. resource: `milkshake make resource` creates a resource file for you under
`src/resources`. Resources will be described in later sections
5. rule: `milkshake make rule` will create a custom validation rule under
`src/validationRules`. Validation rules will be described in later sections.

### keygen

This command creates a new key for your application and sets it in `.env.local`
file.
