## Configuration

All NGNJs config files are located in `config/` directory. This directory
is created by NGNJs initialization:

1. rateLimit: This file is configuration for *withThrottle* middleware to 
throttle your users' api requests. This middleware is enabled globally by
default, but you can comment it if you want. You will learn how to set
a middleware globally later in this section.
   
2. trustedProxies: An array of ip addresses to be considered trusted. If
request is sent to your application from these IPs, `req.ip` will be
`X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-Ip` header in case of existence. Otherwise,
`req.ip` will be *remote address*
   
3. middlewares: You can manage global middlewares in this file. This file
returns an object which maps endpoints to a group of middlewares.
custom middlewares could be created using `milkshake make middleware`
command.
   
### Using global custom middlewares
Imagine you created a middleware called *withUser* which you want to apply
it to all api endpoint starts with `/users`. You can change *middlewares*
config file like bellow:

```javascript
import withUser from "../src/middlewares/withUser"

const middlewares = {
    "/": [
        //All global middlewares
    ],
    "/users": [withUser]
}

export default middlewares;
```
