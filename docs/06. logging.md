## Logging

Logging is NGNJs is as simple as importing `Logger` class. Log files are
located in `storage/logs/` directory. new log file is generated each day and
older log files **are never deleted**. Logs can be submitted in 8 different
levels: (*emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info, debug*)
These levels are the priority of log message. You can set *LOG_LEVEL* env
variable to ignore logs with levels less than *LOG_LEVEL* to be logged.

### logging in server-side

Since logging required *filesystem* support, you can use *Logger* class only
in server-side. This class uses singleton pattern and you need to create
an instance of it with `getInstance()` static method like the code bellow:

```javascript
import Logger from "ngn/dist/services/logger/Logger"

const logger = Logger.getInstance();
logger.error("ERROR", {notFrom: "NGNJs"});
```

### logging in client-side

although you cannot use Logger class to log messages in client-side, an
API endpoint will be created for you called *log* on NGNJs initialization.
You can use that API to use logging feature client-side:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

axios.post("/api/log", {
    level: "ERROR",
    message: "ERROR",
    context: {notFrom: "NGNJs"}
})
```
