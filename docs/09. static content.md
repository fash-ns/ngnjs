## Static content

You may want to show an image you've uploaded before. A solution is to use
third party services like *AS3*. You can also access all of your files
located in `storage/public/` with `/api/storage` endpoint. for example,
consider a file located in `storage/public/images/1.jpg`. You can view it
by calling `/api/storage/images/1.jpg` in browser.

**CAUTION**: Using storage endpoint is not optimized, and it's highly
recommended to you to use aliases to point `storage/public` to `/storage`
with your webserver config.

### creating file URL and path

You can use *Path* facade to generate URL and/or path of a file located in
`storage` directory. *Path* facade has some methods which is described
bellow by an example. (In this example, project is in
`/var/www/http/ngn` directory):

```javascript
import Path from "ngn/dist/facades/Path";

const imagePath = '/images/1.jpg';

Path.makeStorageUrl(imagePath);
    //returns http://localhost:3000/api/storage/images/1.jpg
Path.makePublicStoragePath(imagePath);
    //returns /var/www/http/ngn/storage/public/images/1.jpg
Path.makeStoragePath(imagePath);
   //returns /var/www/http/ngn/storage/images/1.jpg
Path.makeUploadsPath(imagePath);
   //returns /var/www/http/ngn/storage/public/uploads/images/1.jpg
```

*Note*: You have to set *STORAGE_BASE_URL* env variable to use
*makeStorageUrl* method.
