## Errors

Almost all API errors are caught using NGN request handler. There are two
main types of errors:

1. NGNError: THis error is a throwable class with extended from javascript
native *Error* class. NGNError expects three arguments:
   
   - status: status code of response when error is thrown.
   - message: error message
   - context: an object which holds additional data about error and
    returned in response.
     
   Feel free to develop your own errors with even default status code or
   message by extending this class.
   
2. NGNSilentError: Is NGNError but error message and context is shown
   to user only when *APP_DEBUG* env variable is set to true and
   *Server error* message will be returned otherwise. You always have
   error details in logs by the way.
