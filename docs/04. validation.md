## Validation

Form validation can be done in both client and server side using validation
rules. Validation rules are some javascript classes which must have two
methods implemented:

1. `public async evaluate(object)`: Has only one argument which is the value
of the key you mapped to a rule. This value is passed to validation rule
class automatically when it's called. Your validation logic should be
implemented in this method and returns *true* on validation success and
*false* otherwise.
   
2. `public getError(fieldName)`: fieldName mapped to a rule will be passed
automatically to this method. This method should return a message which
contains error information on validation error.
   
You can also implement the constructor method if you want to pass some data
to your validator class.

There are some rules implemented in NGNJs out-of-the-box:

- EmailRule: Validates an email address using regex.
- InRule: Validates if value under validation is existed in an array.
- NumberRule: Checks if value is a number
- RequiredRule: Checks if value is existed.
- StringRule: Checks if value type is string.

#### An example of implementing a rule:

You can create a custom rule using `milkshake make rule`. the code 
bellow is InRule which is implemented in NGNJs:

typescript:
```typescript
import Rule from "ngn/dist/services/validator/rules/Rule";

class InRule implements Rule {
   private readonly arr: Array<string|number>;
   constructor(arr: Array<string|number>) {
      this.arr = arr;
   }
   evaluate(object: any): boolean {
      return ((!object && typeof object !== "boolean") || this.arr.includes(object));
   }

   getError(fieldName: string): string {
      const arrayString = JSON.stringify(this.arr);
      return `${fieldName} must be in ${arrayString}`;
   }
}

export default InRule;
```

javascript:
```javascript
class InRule{
    arr;
    constructor(arr) {
        this.arr = arr;
    }
    evaluate(object) {
        return ((!object && typeof object !== "boolean") || this.arr.includes(object));
    }

    getError(fieldName) {
        const arrayString = JSON.stringify(this.arr);
        return `${fieldName} must be in ${arrayString}`;
    }
}

export default InRule;
```

### Using validators in pages

Using validation in pages (both CSR and SSR) is done using `validate` function. This function gets two args:

- An object maps field names to an array of rules as the first argument.
- The object you want to validate as the second argument.

validate function returns an object with two keys:

- result: a boolean value which is true on validation success and false otherwise
- errors: an object of errors which maps field names to errors.

For example imagine you have a form which creates a key in a state on input changes:

```jsx
import {useState} from "react";
import validate from "ngn/dist/services/validator/validate";
import EmailRule from "ngn/dist/services/validator/rules/EmailRule";
import RequiredRule from "ngn/dist/services/validator/rules/RequiredRule";

const Form = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState({});
    const fillData = (e) => setData(state => ({...state, [e.target.name]: e.target.value}));
    const validateForm = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        // We will implement validate method later
    } 
    
    return (
        <form onSubmit={validateForm}>
           <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="name" onChange={fillData}/><br/>
           <input type="text" name="surname" placeholder="surname" onChange={fillData}/><br/>
           <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="email address" onChange={fillData}/><br/>
           <button type="submit">Send</button>
        </form>
    )
}
```

Now we have something like bellow in `data` variable after filling form:

```json
{
   "name": "Farbod",
   "surname": "Shams",
   "email": "farbodshams.2000@gmail.com"
}
```

So want we want to validate is this object. We can use `validate` asynchronous function like this:

```javascript
const validateForm = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    validate({
       name: [new RequiredRule()],
       surname: [new RequiredRule()],
       email: [new RequiredRule(), new EmailRule()],
    }).then(res => {
        if(!res.result)
            console.error("Validation error: ", errors)
       else {
           //Do main thing
        }
    })
} 
```

### Using validators in API

In api you can simply use `req.validate` asynchronous function. Is has only one argument which is an object maps field
names to an array of rules. All of your request data (query string, body and files) are passed to validator function
automatically. `req.validate` throws an `ValidationError` error on request is not validate with rules check. This error
is automatically caught and returns an object holds message and errors with the status code of *422*.
